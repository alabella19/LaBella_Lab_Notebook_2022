__Goals__ Analyse the Reverse Jump MCMC analysis conducted in BayesTraits on the correlated evolution of growth traits and generalist/specialists.

__Methods__ 

- Analyze trace files in TRACER to ensure convergence - use both the likelihood AND the ESS to determine if the analysis has run long enough
- Create custom R script to determine the frequency of various models - this was created in an R-markdown file called trace_to_model_counts.Rmd 
- Tested to see if any rates are zero - from reading the paper it seems like it should be well above 80% zero score

__Results__ I'm still trying to figure out which comes first, gain of growth or gain of generalist in specific carbon sources


__Additional Things__

Started this lab notebook!!

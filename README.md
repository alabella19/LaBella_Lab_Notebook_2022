# LaBella_Lab_Notebook_2022
Model Computational Lab Notebook for the LaBella Lab

This project contains a model of the expected computational notebook for all trainees. 

This notebook serves several purposes including:

1. Ensuring that your work is reproducable both for yourself, future researchers and myself (your PI)
2. Allows me (your PI) to monitor your progress and see the results of your work. The intnet is _not_ for me to spy on you but to ensure that you continue to make good progress
3. Allow you to share your work, scripts or methods with others in the lab so they know who has expertise or experience with various methods 


While this takes significant effort on your part it will pay off! At some point every researcher will need to replicate their work after an unexpected loss of files. 


## Format

While you can use the format or system that works best for you please address each of the following questions in your daily lab notebook 

1. What question, hypothesis or goal did you work on today?
2. What methods, scripts, or tools did you use?
3. Did you produce any signficant results? If so what were they?
